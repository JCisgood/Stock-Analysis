## Challenge Oveview
In this challenge, you will edit your code to perform the same analysis of stocks in 2018, but you will switch the nesting order of your for loops in order to run the analysis faster. Reworking code is known as refactoring and is a key part of the coding process.

You can think of refactoring as rewriting a draft of an essay. The first time we write code, our focus is on getting it to work correctly. After we’re done with the first “draft” of code, we can then look to see how we could accomplish the same task with code that runs more quickly or is easier to understand. Therefore, refactoring is the process of accomplishing the same task with our code, but in a more efficient way.

## Background
Steve is grateful for your help and loves the workbook you prepared for him. What he doesn’t love, however, are the returns on the stocks in 2018. Steve wants to do a little more research for his parents and is gathering data for the entire stock market over the last few years. While your code works great for a dozen stocks, it might not work so well for thousands of stocks. (Remember, you had to loop through all of the stock data for each ticker you analyzed.)

To help Steve, refactor your code. Remember, refactoring is like writing another draft of your code. You aren’t trying to add new functionality—you just want to make the code more efficient, whether by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or making the code easier to read.

Refactoring is common on the job, as first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

You’re going to refactor your code for Steve to loop through the data only once and collect all of the information it needs in a single pass.

## Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

Analyze code and explain how it accomplishes a task.
Evaluate logic flow of for loops and conditionals.
Extend your pattern recognition skills to refactor existing code.
